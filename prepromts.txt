PROJECT: Kubernetes (local) + Docker + Django API + PostgreSQL
OWNER: Augusto Pampaluna
LOCATION: Netherlands (Amsterdam) | Job search focus: Backend Python roles (NL/remote)
SOURCE OF TRUTH: CV file already uploaded to project (do not invent skills/experience beyond it)

1) PURPOSE (WHY)
Build real hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes from scratch, end-to-end:
- A Django REST API backed by PostgreSQL
- Containerized with Docker (Dockerfile + docker-compose)
- Orchestrated locally with Kubernetes (kind or minikube)
- Optional CI (GitHub Actions)
Goal: be able to explain, run, debug, and demonstrate everything (repo + README). No “Kubernetes de cartón”.

2) SCOPE (MVP)
MVP API (pick a domain aligned with music/DJ or generic):
- CRUD endpoints (e.g., tracks/artists/labels or bookmarks/notes)
- Auth: optional (JWT preferred if time allows)
- Admin + migrations
- Tests: at least basic API tests

Infrastructure:
- Dockerfile for API + docker-compose (api + postgres)
- Kubernetes manifests:
  - Deployment + Service for API
  - Deployment + Service for PostgreSQL (learning purpose)
  - ConfigMap (non-secret settings)
  - Secret (DB password, Django secret key)
  - PVC for PostgreSQL persistence
  - Ingress (NGINX) to expose the API locally
- Operations:
  - scale replicas
  - rolling updates
  - rollback
  - basic debugging (logs/describe/exec)

Out of scope (for now):
- Paid cloud deployments
- Managed DB in cloud
- Complex microservices/event-driven architecture

3) DEFINITION OF DONE (ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA)
- “docker compose up” runs the stack and API responds successfully.
- “kubectl apply -k …” (or apply -f) deploys API + DB on local cluster.
- Ingress routes traffic to the API locally (e.g., http://api.local/health).
- Can demonstrate:
  - kubectl get pods/svc/ingress
  - kubectl logs
  - kubectl describe
  - kubectl exec
  - kubectl rollout status / undo
  - kubectl scale
- README contains:
  - prerequisites
  - one-command setup
  - validation steps
  - troubleshooting section

4) DEFAULT TECH CHOICES (KEEP SIMPLE)
- Framework: Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Server: gunicorn
- Container: Docker
- Local K8s: choose ONE by default:
  - Preferred: kind (runs on Docker, fast iteration)
  - Alternative: minikube (if needed)
- Ingress: NGINX Ingress Controller (local)

5) WORKFLOW RULES (HOW THE ASSISTANT SHOULD RESPOND)
For any task or stage, always output:
- Objective
- Steps
- Commands (copy/paste-ready)
- Validation (“expected output”)
- Common errors + debug commands
Constraints:
- Prefer minimal viable solutions first, then improvements.
- Avoid overengineering.
- Keep naming consistent (api/db/dev).
- Each stage ends with a commit-ready deliverable list.

6) ROADMAP (STAGES)
Stage 0 — Repo bootstrap
- repo structure + initial README + env example

Stage 1 — API
- models + endpoints + migrations + basic tests
Deliverable: working local run + tests

Stage 2 — Docker
- Dockerfile + docker-compose (api + postgres)
Deliverable: docker compose up works + README instructions

Stage 3 — Kubernetes core
- manifests for api + db + config/secret + pvc
Deliverable: kubectl apply works + pods healthy

Stage 4 — Ingress + operations
- ingress config, scaling, rollouts, rollback, debug drills
Deliverable: exposed endpoint + demonstration commands

Stage 5 — Optional CI
- GitHub Actions: tests + build image (optional push)
Deliverable: CI badge + pipeline runs

7) CV CLAIMS POLICY (VERY IMPORTANT)
Only include in CV what is demonstrable:
- If Docker is used only for local dev: say “Containerized for local dev using Docker/docker-compose”.
- Kubernetes: only after Stage 3/4. Mention “local cluster (kind/minikube)” explicitly.
- Never claim production K8s experience if not done.

After each completed stage, generate:
- 2–3 CV bullets (honest, ATS-friendly)
- 3–5 interview questions I should answer
- a short “what I learned” summary for LinkedIn (optional)

8) KEYWORDS (ATS)
Docker, Dockerfile, docker-compose, containers
Kubernetes, kubectl, Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret, PVC
Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, migrations, gunicorn
CI/CD, GitHub Actions (optional)
